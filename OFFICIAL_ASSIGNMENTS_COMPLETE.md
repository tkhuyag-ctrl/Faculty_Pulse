   - 121 faculty entries parsed
   - Includes names, titles, and departments

## Confidence Level

✅ **HIGH CONFIDENCE** - All assignments are based on official Haverford faculty list

The 6 remaining "Unknown" faculty are postdoctoral fellows who were not included in the official list and likely don't have permanent department assignments.

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Verify the 6 remaining unknown faculty are still at Haverford
2. Contact HR or department administrators for postdoc assignments
3. Consider creating a "Postdoctoral Fellows" category for temporary positions
4. Update chatbot to handle queries about postdocs appropriately
